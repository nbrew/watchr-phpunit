watchr-phpunit
==============

Watchr configuration for PHPUnit and Growl.

Autotesting simplicity using PHPUnit and watchr.

Integrates [watchr](https://github.com/mynyml/watchr) with phpunit and [Growl](http://growl.info).

Installation and Usage
======================

1. Install watchr, Growl and growlnotify (part of the Growl extras).
2. Unless the directory is already present, move/copy/link watchr_images to ~/.watchr_images.
3. Copy watchr.rb into the root of your project.

This configuration assumes all tests are contained in a 'Test' directory at the root of your project and that all test file names end with ".php".

Now fire up a new console/terminal session, cd into your project directory and run:

    `watchr watchr.rb`
